* Firstly, Choose ùëÖùê∑ to meet the CM output level spec "500mV".
    * $I_D=I_{ss}/2 = 20ŒºA$
    * So $R_D=500mV/20ŒºA = 25kŒ©$
    * Note: ISS*RD must be smaller than (VDD ‚Äì ùëâùëëùë†ùëéùë°3) for proper large signal characteristics (why?)
        * because the VDS‚Üì (current source) till goes out the saturation  
* Secondly, $V^{*}=\frac{2V_{RD}}{A_v}= 200mV$ 
* Sizing the diff pair according to that
    * **W=13.86Œºm**

* Differential AC magnitude = 1 , and CM AC magnitude = 0

* Avd = -gm*RD= -200us * 25kohm = -5

* BW = 1/(2œÄ*RD*Cout) , Cout = CL+ Cdb + Cgd(1-Ao) = 1p + 10.5f + 4.5 * 6 
    * BW = 6.136 MHz 

||Analytical|Simulation|Comment|

|Avd |-5 |4.823|Gain is less than expected as ro is neglected|
|BW | 6.13MHz |6.466MHz|BW is higher than expected as ro is neglected |


* CM AC magnitude = 0, Differential AC magnitude = 1 

* AvCM = (-gm*RD)/(1+2gm*Rss) 
    * gm = 200 us, RD = 25 kohm, Rss = 1/2.586us =386.7 kohm
    * AvCM = 0.032
* CMRR = Avd/AvCM = 5/ 0.032 = 156.25

4. **Differential Large Siganl ccs** 
* Vid = -VDD:10m:VDD. Set Vicm at the center of the CMIR.

* @vid = -1.2 , Vod = Iss*RD = 40uA * 25Kohm = 1 Volt 
* @vid = 1.2 , Vod = -Iss*RD = 40uA * 25Kohm = -1 Volt

5. **CM large signal ccs (region vs VICM)**

* CMIR analytically
    * -|VGS1|+|VDsat1|+VRD =< ViCM <= VDD -|VGS1|-|VDsat3|
    * VGS1 = 428.339mV, VDsat = VDsat2 = 165.135mV, VRD = 500mV
    * 236.8mV =< ViCM <= 606.526mV
* From Simulation CMIR 
    * 250mv : 610mV

* The CMIR is ~ 250 to 610 mV

*	Input Pairs go into saturation after $V_{iCM_{min}}$

*   Current Source goes out the saturation region after the $V_{iCM_{max}}$

6. **CM large signal ccs (GBW vs Vicm)**

* Report CM large signal ccs (Avd vs Vicm). Assume the valid range for Vicm (CMIR) is defined by the condition that Avd is within 90% of the max gain, i.e., 10% drop in gain.
    * note this is done by AC analysis as mentioned in the lab pdf file
* CMIR = 304.7 : 690.84 mV

![Alt text](image-10.png)

* GBW vs ViCM is more meaningful as it is related to the specs , even input pair went out the saturation region it still acceptable as the GBW is >= 90% from it‚Äôs max value
